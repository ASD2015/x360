===Current revision: r10===
||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||60%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is weirdly supported (see known issues)||
||File Reading:||100%||full file read support with error-checking (I think)||
||Partitions:||5%||partition 3 support only; automatic size detection||
||Multi-User Support:||60%||mounted files have user's uid/gid as owner uid/gid; user can set arbitrary uid/gid for owner||

Options:
||Option:||Effect:||
||-d||Debug Mode||
||-g||Set group GID (decimal)||
||-h||Usage Message (also no arguements)||
||-o||Offset-Beginning of partition (decimal)||
||-u||Set owner UID (decimal)||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * '-o' only takes offsets in decimal notation.
 * Time is theoretically supported (which means it's fully supported, but I can't figure out why the last access date is 2048 :) At least it won't all be 1970 anymore :)

Comments:
 * You are no longer forced to use debug mode (yay!) To enable debug mode, use the option '-d' on the command line.
 * FATX images can be mounted. If you pass a normal file to be mounted, the partition offset is set to zero (so that the image can be of the partition only, instead of the entire drive)

||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||5%||partition 3 support only; automatic size detection||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)

Comments:
 * Replaced multiplication & division with bit shifts (it seemed as if I was only ever multiplying or dividing by 0x1000 and 0x4000; shifts would be way faster)

||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||3%||multiple partitions are not supported; plan for this in the future||

Known Issues:
 * Offsets are hard-coded for the 120GB hard drive (I'm about 50% done with hard drive size detection)
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * I accidentally took out the variable 'slash', as I thought I was no longer using it. My bad. Just add {{{static const char *slash = "/";}}} somewhere at the top. Fixed in r7.
