||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||3%||multiple partitions are not supported; plan for this in the future||

Known Issues:
 * Offsets are hard-coded for the 120GB hard drive (I'm about 50% done with hard drive size detection)
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
