||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||60%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is weirdly supported (see known issues)||
||File Creation:||100%||Creates an entry in the directory table and allocates a cluster for use||
||File Reading:||100%||full file read support with error-checking||
||File Writing:||80%||grows file with 'truncate()' then writes data in-place||
||File Renaming:||50%||Renaming across directories (moving) is not supported.||
||File Truncation:||40%||Truncating up cannot allocate new clusters (instead returns ENOSPC); Truncating down does not free clusters||
||File Deletion:||100%||Marks directory entry as 'deleted' and frees clusters (have not tested on multi-cluster file)||
||Partitions:||5%||partition 3 support only; automatic size detection||
||Multi-User Support:||60%||mounted files have user's uid/gid as owner uid/gid; user can set arbitrary uid/gid for owner||

Options:
||Option:||Effect:||
||-d||Debug Mode||
||-g||Set group GID (decimal)||
||-h||Usage Message (also no arguements)||
||-o||Offset-Beginning of partition (decimal)||
||-u||Set owner UID (decimal)||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * '-o' only takes offsets in decimal notation.
 * Time problem still exists (and probably will for a long time)

Comments:
 * Write support is theoretically full, but since truncate is crippled, I marked it at 80%.
 * All functions required to use 'gedit' are now (partially) implemented. Go ahead and try it on a dummy fs image. It's fun!
 * Once 'truncate()' and 'readdir()' are fixed, we will have reached Xplorer360-like functionality (except for partitions, but nobody cares about partitions 1 and 2 anyways)

||File Reading:||100%||full file read support with error-checking (I think)||

||Multi-User Support:||60%||mounted files have user's uid/gid as owner uid/gid; user can set arbitrary uid/gid for owner||

||-h||Usage Message (also no arguements)||
||-o||Offset-Beginning of partition (decimal)||
||-u||Set owner UID (decimal)||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * '-o' only takes offsets in decimal notation.
 * Time is theoretically supported (which means it's fully supported, but I can't figure out why the last access date is 2048 :) At least it won't all be 1970 anymore :)

Comments:
 * You are no longer forced to use debug mode (yay!) To enable debug mode, use the option '-d' on the command line.
 * FATX images can be mounted. If you pass a normal file to be mounted, the partition offset is set to zero (so that the image can be of the partition only, instead of the entire drive)

||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||5%||partition 3 support only; automatic size detection||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)

Comments:
 * Replaced multiplication & division with bit shifts (it seemed as if I was only ever multiplying or dividing by 0x1000 and 0x4000; shifts would be way faster)

||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||3%||multiple partitions are not supported; plan for this in the future||

Known Issues:
 * Offsets are hard-coded for the 120GB hard drive (I'm about 50% done with hard drive size detection)
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * I accidentally took out the variable 'slash', as I thought I was no longer using it. My bad. Just add {{{static const char *slash = "/";}}} somewhere at the top. Fixed in r7.
