===Current revision: r7===
||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||5%||partition 3 support only; automatic size detection||

Known Issues:
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)

||Features:||Implementation:||Comments:||
||Directory Listing:||80%||multi-cluster directories are not supported||
||File Stating:||50%||name, file vs directory, and file size are supported; time is not supported||
||File Reading:||95%||full file read support; missing some error-checking so it might fail on a corrupted filesystem||
||Partitions:||3%||multiple partitions are not supported; plan for this in the future||

Known Issues:
 * Offsets are hard-coded for the 120GB hard drive (I'm about 50% done with hard drive size detection)
 * Only 32-bit filesystems are supported (16-bit will need to be supported as well once multiple partitions are supported)
 * I accidentally took out the variable 'slash', as I thought I was no longer using it. My bad. Just add {{{static const char *slash = "/";}}} somewhere at the top. This will be fixed in r7.
